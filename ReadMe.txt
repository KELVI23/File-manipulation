I have included in this folder the accounts.dat file, accounts.idx and the accounts.csv.

When running display.c user will be prompted to enter exeName which is Assign8(APP_NAME), dat file name and idx filename. 
If the file does not exist, error message will be displayed to the user and the program will be terminated.
